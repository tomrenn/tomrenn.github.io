# New website, new tech

It has been well overdue to move away from Wordpress. A few months ago
I saw some developer videos from Google about [Polymer](http://webcomponents.org/)
and [web components.](http://webcomponents.org/)
Although the project is still experimential the specs have been standardized, and
chrome (including Android) has full native support.

Aside from that, woohoo! WIP
