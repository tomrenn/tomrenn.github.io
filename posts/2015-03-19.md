# New website, new tech
March 22, 2015

It has been well overdue to move away from Wordpress. Months ago
I came across developer videos from Google about [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
and [web components.](http://webcomponents.org/) It was cool seeing
Material design becoming available for the web but even more fascinating is
the technology behind it. Polymer is still in experimential stages but
web component are standardized (even though not all browsers have support).

Aside from that, woohoo! `WIP`
